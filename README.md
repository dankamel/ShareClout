#### What is it?
An iOS app to design BitClout posts and then share to Instagram stories without screenshotting.

#### What problem does it solve?
BitClout has a distribution problem. 
By being able to seemlessly share posts from BitClout to Web 2 social networks like Twitter and Instagram, we can leverage their network effects and spread the word of decentralised social media to the masses. 

### Notes
The post is shared to Instagram stories as a sticker, so it's moveable and resizeable.
